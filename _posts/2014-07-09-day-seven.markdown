Hi everyone,

Plans are changing as the days go on.  The guidebook timetable is really what I should have planned on.  It seems to know what the body can take.  That being said,  it seems to get finished a lot sooner than I would quit, so a few days I went on to the next town or two. No problem getting a place to stay; some are not so nice, others are wonderful.  I made a decision today to finally take a bus.  I came into Logrono, a pretty big city, and walked right into the Pilgrim information station. They had a bus schedule, a city map, and were only a 20 minute walk from the bus station.  I decided to go there because it was only 1 pm & the day was done as far as the guidebook was concerned, but I was hoping to make up some time. I decided to take the bus from Logrono to Burgos, another big city with a huge cathedral.  This cut 75 miles & 5 days walking off of my trip.  I´m trying NOT to feel guilty but having a hard time of it.  I´m still not certain I can make my goal of getting to Santiago by the 25th.  I´m going to pick up the pace a bit the next few days & go beyond the book.  I may need to give up the end of the earth if I can´t get to Santiago until later.  Oh well...  I was thinking today, ¨Would I ever do this again?¨  My first thought was no way, but then I thought about it for awhile and decided that I might like to do it again with someone who was able to and spend as much time as we needed to do it right... maybe 6 or 7 weeks.  It really is a marvelous trip and so much is missed just walking through as I am... A man with a mission, as you all know.  Anyway, the next few days look relatively easy... I´ve walked 122 miles this far and really the only thing that hurts is my shoulder from the weight of this bag.  I´m thinking of just ditching some of this stuff & taking the loss, but I´ll think about it for another day.  Enjoying the time alone but miss everyone dearly, especially you Theresa, believe it or not.  Did Danny pick up the turkeys today?  I was worrying about it last night & then I re read little Danny´s letter that said not to worry, he & dad would take good care of them.  Made me feel better.  So much I could say, but I´m running out of money on this computer & I still need to go scout out the area for leaving in the morning.  I didn´t get here until 7:30 & took a shower.  Ate earlier in Logrono, maybe I´ll grab a snack when I.m scouting.  Miss you all.  Praying for you all... hope you´re praying for me.  God Bless.  Talk to you soon.  Love you Theresa.  Hug the kids for me!!
