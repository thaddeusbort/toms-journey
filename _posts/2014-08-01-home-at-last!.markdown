Hello everybody,

Sorry for the delayed response.   I arrived at my Marilla home at 3:30 AM Thursday morning, slept a few hours, picked up my 2 grandsons at the farm & drove out to the cottages at Hanford Bay that the family had been renting for the past 10 days.   This is the first opportunity I have had to get near a computer.   The 36 hour airport ordeal between Santiago & Madrid was not unlike my recent trips to South Bend, except that I was 3700 miles away.  I'm safely home now & going to take a few days to unwind & debrief & get into the swing of summer before we are off to visit adult children out of town & get back to our regular summer schedule here on the "farm."  Thanks for sharing my pilgrimage with me & for your prayers.  I look forward to sharing more details as we get together.  God Bless.

Tom
