And so it begins... a few hours from now (12:15 pm) I will birth a journey that began 9 months ago in the planning stages as God planted a seed of desire in my heart to return to him the gratitude he so deserves for granting me these past 20 years of health and prosperity, physically, emotionally, and financially.  My heart is ready, my mind is ready, my body will need to adjust as the physical walking trip begins on Thursday morning from St. Jean Pied de Port, France and leads me up and over the Pyrenees Mountains, separating France from Spain.  

Today, I travel to Toronto with my men's group, have dinner near the airport, and wait there alone from 5:30 for an 8:25 flight into Barcelona, Spain, arriving at 10:05 Tuesday morning.  I spend most of Tuesday traveling across Spain from Barcelona to my starting point in southern France.  

I see God's hand present in every step I take and know he is leading me.  What he has in mind, what his message to me will be, is yet to be known, but I know it will be.  Many of you have given me your specific prayer petitions and I carry in my heart the needs and desires of all of you which I will pray for along the way.  Please pray for me as well, as I embark upon this age-old pilgrimage traveled by saints, popes, kings, and peasants for more than a thousand years.   God bless you all until my next report...
