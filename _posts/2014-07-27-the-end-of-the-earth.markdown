Hi Everyone,

I took a bus trip to Fisterre (Finisterre), the end of the earth today.  Also stopped in Muxia, and stood on the rocks where Martin Sheen threw the rest of his son´s ashes into the Atlantic Ocean.  Both places are awesome, with ocean waves crashing against the rocky shoreline.  I have pictures that will speak for themselves.  It was a wonderful all-day trip, but I missed being at the cathedral today.  I´m going to take a little break and head over there to spend some time praying.  I´ll get to an English mass again tomorrow & Tuesday before I leave.  Looking forward to seeing everyone, but not sure where to begin to tell you about all of this.  It´s almost too much to fathom.  Probably will take a long time to formulate my thoughts about all of it in order to have it make any sense.  I better work on that the next few days.  Arriving back in town on Wednesday, late afternoon.  Until then....  God Bless.

Tom
