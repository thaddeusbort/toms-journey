Theresa,
 
The phone we purchased is not working from here.  That is why I haven't called you. I'm sorry for that.
 
Otherwise, I did  make all my connections, just on time AND got to my hotel around 7 or 8 pm.  Very stressful first day and no time to even eat.  Started off the first day of walking around 8 30 am.  I need to say, that I'm not sure the Marines at Paris Island work out as hard as I did these first 2 days.  I started off yesterday on a clear, sunny day, but of course half way through it started to rain and it rained until the bitter end.  The walk was grueling as I was warned the first day out was the hardest.  Climbing the mountains to around 4600 feet, but not just on paths and not just one mountain. There will be lots of stories to tell when I get home.  It took me until nearly dark to reach the destination.  We started off today by 7 am, and of course it was pouring, nearly all day until about an hour from our finish point.  Needless to say, most of my clothes are soaked and muddy and each time I get to a hostal, the laundry service is full. I"m being very creative with outfits.  I'm thinking of taking a bus tomorow so I can get back on "my schedule."  I also might ditch half of what I brought and ship it to Santiago so it's there when I arrive.  No spiritual insights yet, just trying to stay alive.  You cannot believe how absolutely hard this is, I'm not sure what I was thinking.  Don't know when I'll get another chance to do this, but when the opportunity arises, you'll her from me.  Keep me in your prayers as you are in mine.  Pray for strength and endurance.  Walking for 8 to 10 hours a day, carring that pack, up hill then down hill through all kinds of terrain, in thunderstorms is really wearing me out.  Hopefully, if I can get a bus tomoorrow, I'll feel more hopeful of reaching my goal.  It still feels like cheating, but after these two days, that OK.  God bless you all.
 
Tom
