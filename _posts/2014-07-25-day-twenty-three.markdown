Hola!

Thought I would give you info on what´s happening here.  First, the celebration of Santiago is as big here this week as San Fermin & the running of the bulls was in Pamploma 2 weeks ago when I couldn´t get a bus.  Unfortunayely, it´s not as religious as I would like, but very secular & party-like.  It wasc noisy outside my bedroom window until well past midnight. I mean really loud!  I went to the square in front of the cathedral before all the festivities began.   There were thousands of people there.  There were also tons of police, riot gear, canines, helicopters, you name it for security.  This made me a bit nervous so I stayed near the entrance where I came in for a quick getaway.  Once my area started to become crowded, I decided to walk home.  I watched all the fireworks from my bedroom window from  11-12 am.  Perfect view & even got a few pictures.  The rest of the weekend is filled with bands, concerts, & all kinds of secular fun.  Kind of circus-like.  Anyway, I went to this morning´s service which was a bit of a circus also, but it made me realize just how important St. James really is to ALL of Spain.  Lots of civil dignitaries were at the mass as well as religious.  I saw the insensor used like in the movie.  The Pilgrim´s mass right after that first one was much more serious & again the insensor was used.   I had a 3rd row seat, better than the movie.  What an awesome experience!  Mass twice a day for 2 days.  I think I made up for the 3 Sundays I missed.  Trying to get to the end of the earth this weekend & doing some shopping for the grandkids.  More later.  God Bless.

Tom
