Glory Adios!!  El Señor es Bueno!!

I arrived in Santiago this morning around 9 am.  I decided to take a very short walk yesterday & stay outside the city for housing reasons.

Walked on the July 21st from Ferrerios to Portomarin, and on to Gonzar, Ventas de Naron, Ligonde, Eirexe, & stayed in Palas de Rei. (20.3 miles)  

On July 22nd, I walked a rather long day because housing is becoming an issue...there is none available because lots of people, not just pilgrims, are coming to the festival of St. James which actually starts today on the 24th.  Anyway on the 22nd I walked from Palas de Rei to San Xulian, Melide, Ribadiso, Arzua, A Calzada, A Calle, and stayed in a little private place near Taberna (Salceda).  ( a total of 24 miles)  

On the 23rd, I only walked a short distance & stayed in Lavacolla.  I walke through St. Irene, O Pedrouzo, San Antin, & San Payo.  I was stopped for lunch in Lavacolla & asked if they had any rooms available, knowing it was a long shot because everything is full.  They had 1 left.  I decided to take it even though I had only walked about 11 miles.  I knew I only had about 7 miles to get to Santiago, but by the time I finished lunch it would be 3 pm & those 7 miles could take me 3 hours at the pace I was going.  It was a good move.  

So, here we are today.  I arrived in Santiago around 9 am & walked straight to the center of town, the cathedral, which was a bit of a disappointment.  Mostly because it is covered with scaffolding from some work they are doing, plus all the lights they have strung for the festival.  Oh well; so much for the romantic!!  Anyway, I only stayed a few minutes & walked to the Pilgrim office to get my Compostella for having walked the camino;  I cried again... I´ve been doing that a lot lately.  Went to the Pilgrim mass, but had to stand & didn´t understand a word except Alleluia & Amen.  But I went to mass & communion, something I´ve missed terribly since I left home.  I´m going to find something to eat soon because it´s been since 8 am, & then locate the Franciscan Convent, because they are giving a second Compostella this year because 800 years ago, St. Francis made the camino!!!  What a coincidence!!!  If I can stay in this room the whole time,  it will be so convenient & close to everything; I just have to be sure I can find my way back every day/night.  Anyway, enough for now.  Looking forward to booking a trip to Finisterre & Muxia in a day or two, probably Saturday, &  doing some sight seeing & shopping.  Keep me in your prayers as I do you.  God Bless.   More tomorrow.

[UPDATE]: 7:35 PM CEST

I can´t stop crying either; every place I go & every time I try to write/tell anyone about what´s happening.  God has sent angels to care for me all along the way.  You wouldn´t believe some of it.  Every bed in all of Santiago is full & there are pilgrims wandering around every where with no place to stay.  I was just walking down the street to find the Fransiscan Convent because they were giving a second compostella in honor of St. Francis.  I happened upon a small albergue & walked in to ask if they had a room.  They were full but the girl said I´ll make a call.  Wait 5 minutes she said. I did´n know what for, but in a few minutes, a little old man showed up & signalled me to come with him.  Two doors down he showed me a private room with a bath in the hall for 15 euros a night.  I asked him if I could stay 2 nights.  He didn´t really answer, but I thought I would ask again later.  When I returned later on, his son was there who spoke English.  He said my father thinks you want to stay another night.  I asked if I could stay until Tuesday when I leave & he was thrilled.  He was even more thrilled when I said I would use the same sheets & towels all week. (I do at home anyway).  THe old guy was so happy.  So was I needless to say.  I can see the spires of the cathedral of Santiago out my bedroom window, a 5 minute walk away.  This woman & old man were God´s angels.  I could not have planned a better or closer or more perfect setting.  There are none available!!  God Bless.   Keep praying as I do for all of you.
