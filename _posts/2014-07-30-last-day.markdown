Some of you are familiar with my bad luck traveling lately.  Well, here goes again.  Except today, I´m stuck in Madrid, 3700 miles away.  Can´t very easily rent a car to get home in a  hurry.  At the mercy of Air Canada.  They re-booked me for a flight at 9:30  Madrid time to arrive in Toronto at 12 midnight Toronto time.  I stood in line 2 1/2 hours waiting to get a boarding pass for a flight that took off while I was in line!!  Typical of airline ¨¨efficiency.¨  Probably won´t get to see my grandkids from Cincy now.   Disappointed  & anxious to get home.  Pray this next flight goes well.
