Friends & Family,

The last leg of my pilgrimage begins today.  I am carefully packing my things, making last visits to the places I love the most, and trying to absorb as much as I possibly can from all I see and experience here in Santiago de Compostella.  I attended the English Mass at the cathedral this morning after going to confession.  The Lord has been good, allowing me 6 full days to be here to recuperate from the camino physically, to spiritually get in touch with the Lord in a much deeper way, and to learn as much as I can from the Lord about this experience.  I am taking a taxi to the airport tonight so I am certain not to miss my flight in the AM.  I have had some recent experience sleeping in airports as a result of several South Bend trips. Those who know me well will understand my anxiety over this.  Besides, I am anxious to see everyone, I have NEVER been away from home for this long in my life before  except for my first hospital stay in 1994, but I had visitors daily!  I refuse to be stuck; not even in Santiago!   So I will finish my packing, visit the cathedral one last time, hug SantiagoÂ´s statue & visit his crypt, making my last prayer requests, wander through the local streets & vendors in case I missed anything, look carefully around at all I see, and try to soak up as much as possible before boarding a cab to Santiago airport, where I will fly first to Madrid, then on to Toronto by 4 pm on Wednesday.  Looking forward to seeing everyone & catching up on what I missed, meeting my turkeys that were all born while I was away, and getting back to my life, which I love more than ever!  God bless you all.  Thank you for sharing my journey with me.  God Bless.

Tom
