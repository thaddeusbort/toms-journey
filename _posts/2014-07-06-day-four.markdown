Theresa,

I don´t know if this will get to you. It´s coming fromamn ancient computer that won´t let me do much. I can´t even send it to the camino list.  I cannot open any of my emails either, but to answer your question, NO I did not take the bus that day but I have walked the past 4 days.  I´m planning on taking the bus tomorrow, just to get ahead of schedule.  You can tell the boys if they are checking the map
that I have walked through the following cities...Burguete, Espinal, Viskarret, Alto de Erro, Zubiri, Pamplona, Larrasoana, Zuriain, Zabaldica, Villava, Burlada, Cizur Menor, Zariquiegui, Alto de Perdon (the mountain of forgiveness), Uterga, Obanos, Muruzabal, and Puente de Reina,where I currently am.  Hope to leave on the bus at 8 am and drive to Estella and maybe further.  Need to gain some time and rest
these weary old bones.  If you are home, please send this to my el camino list, as I cannot from here.  Running out of time... have fun with Mandy and the kids...give them my love.  Have Teddy locate an on line map for the boys to track my progress.  Love you all.  See you soon.  God Bless.

Tom
