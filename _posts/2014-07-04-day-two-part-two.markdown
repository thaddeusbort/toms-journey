Hello again,
 
Don't know the next time I'll get to this so I thought I would say a few more words.  The first day I left St. Jean Pied de Port and walked to Rancevalles.  The hardest physical thing I ever did in my life.  It would not have taken much to convince me to quit by the time I got to my room that night \*shared with 200 others.  Today, as we left Rancevalles in the rain, we walked to Zubiri.  Another strenuos workout, but nothing like day 1.  Maybe Danny and Zachary can find these little towns on the map.  Each day was only about 16 miles so I'm well behind my planned schedule of 21 miles per day.  That's why a bus ride tomorrow might be a good idea, it can catch me up plus give my body a rest.  I'm thinking of taking the bus into Pamplona or Cizur Menor.  I could always start walking again from there if I have the energy and get even farther ahead.  Or maybe I can catch the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona!  It seems like no one wants to use this computer because everyone else has their own little devices and just use the WiFi connection.  Lucky for me.  The food leaves a lot to be desired here.  Haven't had what I consider a good meal since Monday night with the kids.  These pants I bought seem to keep getting bigger, they're practically faling off of me, or else I'm just losing more weight. 
 
Theresa, maybe you should try to call me and see if it ges through.  Just don't do it in the middle of the night.  It's 8 51 right now.  Anyway, I miss my home and all of you...Tell Karen, I'm NOT "living the dream," YET... but , maybe it will happen.  It's too early to tell.  God Bless you all.
 
Tom
